dnsdumps
========

Description
-----------
Various DNS dumps: 
* In the [`zones`](https://github.com/maaaaz/dnsdumps/tree/main/zones) folder, you can find, for each grabbed zone, the current full DNS zone (`{today,yesterday}.gz`) and differential datasets (`{today,yesterday}_new.gz`) for newly created domain names
* In the [`daily`](https://github.com/maaaaz/dnsdumps/tree/main/daily) folder, you can find the consolidated newly created domain names dataset (`{today,yesterday}_new.gz`)

UTC is the timezone reference.
